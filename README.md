# InkyBlackness HackEd

HackEd is the main, graphical editor application as part of the [InkyBlackness](https://inkyblackness.github.io) project, written in [Go](http://golang.org/). It allows editing of game files of the original System Shock (1994, and compatible) to create mods and fan-missions.

This application is the successor of the `deck` package of InkyBlackness, which provided the first public editor, even before the source release of the original engine. The rewrite was necessary due to several factors.

## Documentation

Usage of the editor is documented on its [Wiki](https://github.com/inkyblackness/hacked/wiki) page.
Answers and further help about modding can be furthermore found on the [systemshock.org](https://systemshock.org) forums (particularly the `Engineering` subforum.
